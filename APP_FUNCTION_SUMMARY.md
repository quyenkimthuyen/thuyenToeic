# LexiRise App Function Summary

LexiRise is a standalone, frontend-only vocabulary app. The app UI runs from `index.html`, while vocabulary words are loaded dynamically from JSON files in the `data/` folder. It does not need Vite, React, npm, backend API, authentication, or a database.

## How To Use

1. Open the folder through a simple static server so the browser can read `data/*.json`.
2. Study, quiz, and track progress.

The app has no visible JSON load/export buttons. Browser progress is saved in `localStorage`.

Optional start command:

```bash
npm start
```

## Topic JSON Files

Words are stored in `data/`, with one JSON file per topic. The app automatically loads the known topic files from that folder, and can discover extra `.json` files when the static server exposes directory listing.

The topic name is the filename without `.json`, so `data/toeic-airport.json` becomes topic `toeic-airport`.

Current topics:

- `toeic-airport`
- `toeic-all`
- `toeic-banking`
- `toeic-business`
- `toeic-finance`
- `toeic-hotel`
- `toeic-marketing`
- `toeic-meetings`
- `toeic-office`
- `toeic-technology`
- `toeic-travel`

Topic file example:

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "word-001",
  "word": "abandon",
  "ipa_us": "/əˈbæn.dən/",
  "ipa_uk": "/əˈbæn.dən/",
  "meaning_vi": "từ bỏ",
  "topic": "toeic-airport",
  "example": "She refused to abandon her dream.",
  "audio_us": "https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/media/pronunciations/en/abandon-us.mp3",
  "status": "new",
  "reviewLevel": 0,
  "reviewCount": 0,
  "createdAt": 1771142156378
}
```

Important fields:

- `word`: English word.
- `meaning_vi`: Vietnamese meaning.
- `topic`: learning topic; if omitted, the app uses the JSON filename.
- `audio_us`: optional audio path or internet URL, such as `audio/word.mp3` or a public `.mp3` URL.
- `example`: optional example sentence.
- `ipa_us`: optional American pronunciation text.

Put local audio files in the `audio/` folder or use public internet audio URLs in topic JSON files under `data/`. If `audio_us` is empty or cannot play, the app falls back to browser text-to-speech.

To add more topics, create another JSON file in `data/`.

## Main Functions

### Learn Vocabulary

- Shows a vocabulary learning screen.
- Keeps JSON source/import instructions out of the main learning GUI.
- Lets the user filter vocabulary by topic.
- Limits the active learning queue to 10 words.
- Shows words in a stable randomized order instead of JSON order.
- Displays English word, American IPA, Vietnamese meaning, and example sentence when available.
- Lets the user reveal or hide the meaning.
- Plays `audio_us` from a compact pronunciation button in the card action row, otherwise uses browser speech synthesis.
- Hides `Forgot` on learning words and hides `Remembered` on known words.
- Lets the user mark eligible words as `Remembered` or `Forgot`, then reshuffles the word order.
- Refills the learning queue with new words after remembered words become known.

### Search And Filter

- Searches by English word, Vietnamese meaning, or IPA.
- Searches by topic name.
- Keeps focus in the search box while typing.
- Filters words by topic, including `toeic words`.
- Filters words by status: `Learning`, `Known`, or `All Status`.
- Saves the selected filter and search query locally.

### Quiz Practice

Quiz modes:

- Meaning: shows the English word and asks for the Vietnamese meaning.
- English: shows the Vietnamese meaning and asks for the English word.
- Listen: plays `audio_us` or text-to-speech and asks for the Vietnamese meaning.
- Typing: shows the Vietnamese meaning and asks the user to type the answer.

Quiz behavior:

- Shows the selected quiz topic on the quiz screen and lets the user change it before starting.
- Builds each test from up to 20 unique words in the selected topic, or all available words when the topic has fewer than 20.
- Uses multiple-choice answers for non-typing modes, with up to four choices depending on the topic size.
- Compares answers case-insensitively after trimming whitespace.
- Automatically advances to the next question after a correct answer.
- Automatically submits typing answers when the typed text matches the correct English word.
- Automatically plays the word audio or speech fallback when a listening question first appears.
- Tracks total answers, correct answers, streak, elapsed time, and accuracy.
- Supports quiz reset.

### Progress And Stats

- Shows total word count.
- Shows known word count.
- Shows learning word count.
- Shows scheduled review count.
- Shows completion percentage with a progress bar.
- Shows recently known words.
- Shows the current learning queue.
- Shows stats for the selected topic or all topics.
- Provides a reset button to clear saved browser progress and reload fresh data from `data/`.

## Data And Storage

Editable source data:

- one JSON file per topic in `data/`

Optional audio files:

- `audio/`

Browser storage key:

- `lexirise-vocabulary-store`

Persisted data:

- vocabulary words
- Vietnamese meanings
- topics
- audio paths
- review progress
- selected filter
- selected topic filter
- search query
- selected theme
- selected quiz mode

Not persisted:

- current quiz question
- current quiz results
- quiz timer
- temporary card reveal state

## Current File Structure

- `index.html`: standalone app UI and logic.
- `data/*.json`: topic vocabulary files.
- `data/README.md`: topic data instructions.
- `audio/`: optional local audio files.
- `APP_FUNCTION_SUMMARY.md`: this function summary.
- `package.json`: optional metadata only.
- `.cursor/rules/`: project rules for future AI changes.

## Limitations

- Browsers do not allow reliable JSON loading from `file://`; use a simple static server.
- Extra topic files beyond the known checked-in JSON files require a server that exposes directory listing, or the file must be added to the app's fallback topic list.
- There is no backend sync between devices.
- Progress is stored only in the current browser unless exported.
- Audio playback requires valid local paths or public internet URLs in `audio_us`.
